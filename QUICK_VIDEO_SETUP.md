# Quick Video Setup - Step by Step

## Fastest Option: Use Canva (Free, ~30 minutes)

### Step 1: Create Videos in Canva
1. Go to https://www.canva.com (free account)
2. Click "Create a design" → "Video"
3. Choose "Training Video" template or start blank
4. For each module:
   - Add slides with key points from the scripts
   - Use Canva's text-to-speech (Magic Media) for narration
   - Add simple graphics/icons
   - Export as MP4 (720p is fine)

### Step 2: Download and Save
1. Download each video
2. Rename them:
   - `seizure-protocol.mp4`
   - `abc-data-collection.mp4`
   - `de-escalation-basics.mp4`
3. Move files to: `public/videos/` folder

### Step 3: Update Your App
The videos will automatically work! The current URLs in `data.js` are already set up for local files.

## Alternative: Use Sample Videos (For Testing)

If you want to test the app immediately while creating videos:

1. The app currently uses sample videos that work
2. You can test all functionality now
3. Replace videos later when ready
