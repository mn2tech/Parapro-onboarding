---

Welcome to the Emergency Response Protocol training module. This training is essential for all paraprofessionals working in educational settings. Your quick and appropriate response during emergency situations can make a critical difference in student safety and wellbeing.

In educational settings, various emergency situations may arise that require immediate attention. These situations can present in different ways and may include sudden changes in student behavior or responsiveness, unusual movements or physical responses, changes in student awareness or consciousness, physical distress signals, and unexpected physical reactions. It's important to be observant and recognize when a student may need immediate support.

When a student experiences an emergency situation, follow these important response steps.

Step 1: Maintain Composure. Take a moment to breathe and remain calm. Your composed demeanor helps create a safe environment for everyone. Clear thinking is essential during emergency situations.

Step 2: Create a Safe Environment. Remove any nearby objects that could cause harm. Ensure the area around the student is clear. Provide cushioning if possible and safe to do so. Never attempt to restrain a student during an emergency. Never place objects in a student's mouth.

Step 3: Time the Situation. Note the exact time when the situation began. Most emergency situations resolve within a few minutes. If a situation continues beyond five minutes, contact emergency services immediately.

Step 4: Positioning for Safety. If safe to do so, gently help position the student on their side. This positioning can help maintain clear airways. Adjust any clothing that may restrict breathing.

Step 5: Observation and Documentation. Monitor the student's condition carefully. Note the duration of the situation. Observe and remember specific behaviors or responses for documentation.

Contact emergency services immediately if the situation continues for more than five minutes, a second emergency situation begins before the student fully recovers, the student sustains an injury during the situation, there are concerns about the student's breathing, the emergency occurs in a potentially dangerous environment like water, or the student has documented health conditions that require immediate professional attention.

After the emergency situation has resolved, remain with the student until they are fully alert and responsive. Use calm, reassuring communication. Understand that confusion or fatigue afterward is common. Allow adequate time for recovery. Document the incident following your school's established procedures. Communicate with parents or guardians as required by your school's policy.

Remember, your role is to maintain student safety and provide supportive care. Stay calm, follow your school's established protocols, and contact emergency services when necessary. Thank you for completing this important training module.

## 🎥 Module 2: ABC Data Collection

Welcome to ABC Data Collection training. ABC stands for Antecedent, Behavior, and Consequence. This systematic approach to data collection helps us understand why behaviors occur and how to support students effectively.

ABC data collection is a method used to record what happened right before the behavior, the specific behavior that occurred, and what happened immediately after the behavior. This information helps identify patterns and triggers, which is essential for developing effective behavior support plans.

The Antecedent is what happens before the behavior. When recording, be specific about what activity was happening, who was present, what was said or done, what the environment was like, and what time of day it was. For example, during math class, when the teacher asked a student to solve a problem on the board, in front of classmates.

The Behavior is what the student actually did. Be objective and specific. Describe what you saw, not what you think it means. Use measurable terms like duration, frequency, and intensity. Avoid judgmental language. A good example would be: The student threw their pencil, stood up, and said they couldn't do this loudly. Avoid phrases like the student had a tantrum or was being difficult.

The Consequence is what happened immediately after the behavior. Consider how adults responded, how peers responded, what the student gained or avoided, and whether the behavior stopped or continued. For example, the teacher asked the student to sit down, the class reacted, and the student was sent to the counselor's office.

When recording ABC data, record as soon as possible after the behavior, be objective and factual, include all three components, note the date, time, and location, and use the school's data collection form.

Accurate ABC data collection is the foundation for understanding student behavior and developing effective support strategies. Your careful observation and documentation make a real difference. Thank you for your attention to this important skill.

## 🎥 Module 3: De-Escalation Basics

Welcome to De-Escalation Basics training. This module will teach you essential techniques for safely managing challenging situations and helping students return to a calm, regulated state.

Behavioral escalation typically follows stages. First is the calm stage, where the student is regulated and ready to learn. Then comes the trigger stage, where something causes stress or frustration. Next is agitation, where the student shows signs of distress. This leads to acceleration, where behavior intensifies. Then comes the peak stage, where crisis behavior occurs. This is followed by de-escalation, where the student begins to calm. Finally, recovery occurs, where the student returns to baseline. The goal is to intervene early, before reaching the peak stage.

Recognize these early signs of escalation: increased fidgeting or restlessness, changes in voice tone or volume, clenched fists or tense body language, avoidance of eye contact or excessive eye contact, verbal complaints or negative statements, and withdrawal from activities or peers. When you notice these signs, it's time to use de-escalation strategies.

Here are key de-escalation techniques. First, stay calm. Your calm energy can help calm the student. Take deep breaths. Maintain a neutral, non-threatening posture. Speak in a calm, even tone.

Second, give space. Maintain appropriate physical distance. Don't crowd or corner the student. Allow personal space. Create an exit route if possible.

Third, use active listening. Acknowledge the student's feelings. Use phrases like I can see you're upset or This seems really frustrating. Avoid minimizing their feelings. Don't argue or debate.

Fourth, offer choices. Give the student some control. Ask questions like, Would you like to take a break or continue here? Or, Would you prefer to talk now or in five minutes? Keep choices simple and appropriate.

Fifth, redirect when possible. Shift focus to a calming activity. Suggest taking a walk or getting some water. Use preferred activities if known. Don't force engagement.

Sixth, set clear, simple limits. Use calm, direct language. Say things like, I need you to keep your hands to yourself. Avoid lengthy explanations during escalation. Be consistent with expectations.

Avoid these actions during escalation: don't take behavior personally, don't raise your voice or match their intensity, don't use physical restraint unless trained and necessary for safety, don't make threats or ultimatums, don't argue or try to reason during peak escalation, and don't ignore the situation.

Once the student has calmed, allow time for recovery. Check in with the student when appropriate. Document the incident. Follow up with support staff as needed. Reflect on what worked and what didn't. Repair relationships if needed.

De-escalation is a skill that improves with practice. Remember to prioritize safety, stay calm, and use these techniques to support students through challenging moments. Thank you for your commitment to creating a safe learning environment.
