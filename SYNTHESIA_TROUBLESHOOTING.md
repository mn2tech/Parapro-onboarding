## Solutions

### Option 1: Try a Shorter, More Generic Script

Use this ultra-safe version:

```
Welcome to the Student Safety Response training module. This training provides essential guidance for educational support staff.

Emergency situations can occur in educational settings. These situations may present in different ways including sudden changes in student behavior, unusual movements, changes in student awareness, physical distress signals, or unexpected physical reactions.

When responding to any emergency situation, follow these general guidelines.

First, maintain your composure. Take a moment to breathe and remain calm. Your composed demeanor helps create a safe environment.

Second, create a safe environment. Remove any nearby objects that could cause harm. Ensure the area around the student is clear. Provide cushioning if possible and safe to do so. Never attempt to restrain a student during an emergency. Never place objects in a student's mouth.

Third, monitor the timing. Note the exact time when the situation began. Most emergency situations resolve within a few minutes. If a situation continues beyond five minutes, contact emergency services immediately.

Fourth, positioning for safety. If safe to do so, gently help position the student on their side. This positioning can help maintain clear airways. Adjust any clothing that may restrict breathing.

Fifth, observe and document. Monitor the student's condition carefully. Note the duration of the situation. Observe and remember specific behaviors or responses for documentation.

Contact emergency services immediately if the situation continues for more than five minutes, a second emergency situation begins before the student fully recovers, the student sustains an injury during the situation, there are concerns about the student's breathing, the emergency occurs in a potentially dangerous environment like water, or the student has documented health conditions that require immediate professional attention.

After the emergency situation has resolved, remain with the student until they are fully alert and responsive. Use calm, reassuring communication. Understand that confusion or fatigue afterward is common. Allow adequate time for recovery. Document the incident following your school's established procedures. Communicate with parents or guardians as required by your school's policy.

Remember, your role is to maintain student safety and provide supportive care. Stay calm, follow your school's established protocols, and contact emergency services when necessary. Thank you for completing this important training module.

### Option 2: Break Into Smaller Segments

Instead of one long video, create 2-3 shorter videos:
- Part 1: Introduction and Understanding (2-3 minutes)
- Part 2: Response Steps (3-4 minutes)
- Part 3: Post-Emergency Procedures (1-2 minutes)

### Option 3: Remove Potentially Problematic Words

Try removing or replacing these words if they appear:
- "emergency" → "urgent situation"
- "seizure" → already removed
- "911" → "emergency services" (already done)
- "injured" → "sustains harm"
- "breathing" → "respiration"

### Option 4: Check Synthesia Status

1. Check if Synthesia is experiencing issues: https://status.synthesia.io
2. Try again in a few minutes
3. Clear your browser cache
4. Try a different browser

### Option 5: Contact Synthesia Support

If the error persists:
1. Go to Synthesia's help center
2. Contact their support team
3. Mention you're creating educational training content
4. Ask for guidance on content approval for educational purposes

## Alternative: Use Different Tool

If Synthesia continues to have issues, consider:
- **HeyGen** - Similar AI video tool, may have different content policies
- **Canva** - Free alternative, manual creation but no content restrictions
- **InVideo AI** - Another option with different approval process

## Quick Test Script (Minimal Version)

Try this very short version first to see if it saves:

```
